# Touristry
The main objective of the Tourism Management System is to manage the details of Customer, Hotel Booking, Cancellation and Tourism places. It manages all the information about Users, Hotel, Packages etc. The project is totally built at the administrative end and thus only the administrator is guaranteed access to the backend database.
